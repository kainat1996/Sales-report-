### Project Scenario
As a data analyst working for a pizza restaurant chain that operates in the US. The chain wants to improve 
its sales performance and customer satisfaction by leveraging data-driven insights and recommendations. 
You are tasked with creating a pizza sales report using SQL and Power BI tools, based on a dataset 
containing information about pizza orders from January 2015 to December 2015. The dataset includes 
information such as product details, Categories, order dates, and transaction amounts. You will use SQL to 
clean, filter, and transform the data, and Power BI to create interactive and informative visualizations. The 
report will cover the following aspects of pizza sales:

* KPIâ€™s REQUIREMENT
* Charts Requirement
* Daily/Monthly Trend of Sales
* Sales of Product by Category
* Total Revenue and Avg. order value
* Percentage Sales
* Best/Worst Pizzas by Sale
  
The report will also provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis and 
visualizations, such as:

* Promoting the most popular pizza flavors and categories
* Implementing marketing strategies to increase sales during low-demand periods
* Offering discounts and incentives to increase order value and retention
* Improving the quality and efficiency of service
  
The report will be presented to the senior management of the pizza restaurant, who will use it to make 
informed decisions and implement changes to improve the business performance and customer 
satisfaction. The report will also be shared with the staff and managers of the individual restaurant 
locations, who will use it to monitor and improve their operations and sales. The report will be updated 
periodically with new data and insights, as the pizza restaurant chain continues to grow and expand.

### Skills Demonstrated
Some of the skills demonstrated for a pizza sales report are:
* Data acquisition: Obtained the data from various sources and formats, such as databases, CSV files, and 
other data storage systems.
* Data transformation: I have cleaned, filtered, and transformed data using SQL, a structured query 
language for manipulating and analyzing data.
* Data modeling: I designed and implemented a data model that represents the relationships and attributes 
of the data entities, such as customers, product Categories, orders, and transactions.
* Data analysis: Performed in-depth data analysis using SQL queries, such as aggregating, grouping, sorting, 
filtering, and joining data.
* Data visualization: Created interactive and informative visualizations using Power BI, a business 
intelligence tool for creating reports and dashboards.
* Data interpretation: Derived insights and recommendations from the data analysis and visualizations, such 
as identifying sales trends, customer preferences, product performance.
* Communication: Able to present and communicate the data analysis and visualizations in a clear and 
concise manner, using appropriate language, format, and style.

### Summary
This report analyzes and visualizes pizza sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain using SQL 
and Power BI tools. The report covers various aspects of pizza sales, such as product categories, 
flavors, trends, seasonality, preferences, order value, revenue, and restaurant performance. The report 
also provides insights and recommendations to help the pizza restaurant chain optimize its 
operations, improve sales, and enhance customer satisfaction. The report is based on a dataset 
containing information about pizza orders from January 2015 to December 2015. The report is 
intended for the senior management and the staff of the pizza restaurant chain.
Solution
After analyzing the data and gaining insights from SQL and POWER BI I came up with following 
### Recommendations:
* Focus on the products contributed to highest revenue.
* Provide some discounts offers for least sales days and Months.
* Enhance the online ordering, delivery, and carryout services to meet the growing demand 
and convenience of the customers.
* Use technology to streamline the ordering process, track the delivery status, and collect 
feedback from the customers.
*The pizza company should optimize its categories and menu design by offering more variety 
and options for its customers. They can do this by introducing new flavors, toppings, or 
crusts, or by creating combos or bundles that include drinks or sides.
